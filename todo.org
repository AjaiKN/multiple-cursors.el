* TODO: [4/10]
** DONE (set-marker MARKER nil) for performance
** DONE C-g deactivates regions first, before disabling multiple-cursors
** DONE more state to save per cursor: er/history
** DONE refactor: an object with all the current state, used for both overlays and current
** TODO unknown command: Do for (a)ll, (o)nce or (i)gnore -> (did that work ok? (k)eep doing that or (d)on't)
   unknown-command ran once - what now? (o)nce is enough, repeat for (a)ll, (u)ndo - that did NOT work.
   unknown-command ran for all - did that work as expected? (y)es, (n)o
   what to do about unknown-command in the future? Run it (o)nce, or (s)top it from being run.
** TODO separate mark-multiple and multiple-cursors
   mark-multiple goes back to being the util? or just dies?
   given the problem with extract-var and undo, may just kill mark-multiple.
   problem with that is: C-g when doing rename-tag shouldn't go to multiple-cursors.

** TODO add tests
** TODO collapse cursors at same point
** TODO there's something going wrong with last-command/this-command?
   expand-region works nicely, even collapse when we save er/history, but last collapse puts all cursors in same spot

** TODO Create replacements for some common non-working commands
   Possible to do C-s ... how about M-y ?
